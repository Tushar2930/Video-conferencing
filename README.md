# HeavyHurdle Video Conferencing
A small, simple video conferencing web app built using node.js, socket.io, and WebRTC.
It runs on a peer-to-peer design, so it's an ideal choice for communications between 3 nodes or less unless using very powerful machines.
Has plenty of useful features, easy to setup, and designed to reduce load on the host machine.

## Features
* Screen Sharing
* Recording
* Shared Whiteboard (with image support as well!)
